- **Internal navigation**: Anchor links (`#section`) to jump between sections without reloading the page
- **Product catalog**: Articles with detailed specs (price, description, availability, brand, model)
- **Featured products**: Best-selling products list (numbered) with direct links to the catalog
- **Visual indicators**: Progress bars and meters for customer satisfaction and stock
- **Forms**: Purchase (shipping) and contact forms with basic validation
- **Warranty plans**: Comparison table (Basic, Pro, Premium)

### CSS Styling
- **CSS variables**: Theme colors, shadows, and transitions defined in `:root`
- **Layout**: Flexbox and CSS Grid 
- **Fixed sidebar**: Navigation menu fixed on the left
- **Section-based hierarchy**: Styles scoped under `#catalog`, `#cart`, `#plans`, etc.
- **Shared patterns**: Card and hover effects to avoid redundancy
- **Product grid**: 3-column catalog layout with card-style articles
- **Hover effects**: Scale and color transitions on interactive elements
- **Typography**: Segoe UI font family, consistent sizing
- **No frameworks**: Pure HTML and CSS only
